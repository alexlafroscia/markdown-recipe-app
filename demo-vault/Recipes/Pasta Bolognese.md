> The recipe doesn’t list as an ingredient 1 small onion chopped. It gets added after the meat is browned. I only use one egg and chop meat not veal. I also use two sausage links not one. I buy a small package and freeze the others in pairs of two for future recipes. I also only use half the amount of heavy cream and have enough sauce for two pounds of pasta so I use half the sauce a save the other half for another night. Let me know if you have any questions.
